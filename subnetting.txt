Subnetting 
-------------
Create four subnets from the following IP 198.67.23.0

No of subnets = 2^n

Steps taken when subnetting
---------------------------
Step 1: Break down the IP to understand it:
	Class   SubnetMask      CIDRRange
	  C     255.255.255.0   198.67.23.0/24

Step2: Convert the IP from decimal to binary
	198.67.23.0 TO BINARY => 11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000
 
	                                                                              
	128   64  32  16  8  4  2  1 = 128 + 64 +32+16+8+4+2+1= 255

	Subnet 255.255.255.0 to binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Step3: Calculate the number of host bits that be given to the network portion
	as required by the subnets

	No of subnets = 2^n
		4 = 2 ^n => number of host bits(n) = 2
	128   64  32  16  8  4  2  1
	
	11000110.01000011.00010111.11000000
	New CIDR Range for IP = 198.67.23.0/26
	New Subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
	New Subnet mask in decimal = 255.255.255.192
Step4: Identify the four subnet ranges
        New Subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

	Number of usable hosts = 2^n - 2
	Number of total hosts = 2^n
	                      = 2^6 = 64

	Our IP address is 198.67.23.0

	First Subnet range = 198.67.23.0 - 198.67.23.63
	Second subnet range = 198.67.23.64 - 198.67.23.127
	Third Subnet range = 198.67.23.128 - 198.67.23.191
	Fourth subnet range = 198.67.23.192 - 198.67.23.255


Question 2: Create 5 subnets from this IP 198.67.23.0
	
Step 1: Break down the IP to understand it:
        Class   SubnetMask      CIDRRange
          C     255.255.255.0   198.67.23.0/24

Step2: Convert the IP from decimal to binary
        198.67.23.0 TO BINARY => 11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000

Step3: Calculate the number of host bits that be given to the network portion
        as required by the subnets

        No of subnets = 2^n
		5 = 2 ^ n
	        128   64  32  16  8  4  2  1
		Since 5 is not a power of 2, we'll take the next minimum available  number
  		8 = 2 ^ 3

	Number of host bits required(n) to be added to the network = 3
	 11000110.01000011.00010111.11100000
        New CIDR Range for IP = 198.67.23.0/27
        New Subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
        New Subnet mask in decimal = 255.255.255.224

        Number of total hosts = 2^n
			      = 2 ^5 = 32
        We will have a total of 32 hosts per subnet - including the network and broadcast address

	First Subnet range =  198.67.23.0 - 198.67.23.31
	Second subnet range = 198.67.23.32 - 198.67.23.63
	Third subnet range =  198.67.23.64 - 198.67.23.95
	Fourth subnet range = 198.67.23.96 - 198.67.23.127
	Fifth subnet	range = 198.67.23.128 - 198.67.23.159
